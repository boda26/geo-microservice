â€‹	All the errors are reflected by the final response on the frontend.

 1. If the input location is not in the form {latitude,longitude}, or contains irrelevant character, or is not a valid geographical location in the US, the response will be

    ```json
    {
      "errorMessage": "Invalid geographical location!"
    }
    ```



2. If the input location is valid, but the weather forecast is not available at that location, the city IM and state IM can still return the information, but the weather IM will return an error message.

   ```json
   # The input is {20,-155}, Hawaii Islands. National weather forecast is not available at that location.
   {
     "city": "Honomu",
     "lat": 19.8701,

     "state": "HI",
     "weather": "Weather forecast unavailable at this location!"
   }
   ```

   

3. All the other errors will have a same response like (1).
